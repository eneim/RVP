# RVP
Not bad RecyclerView Practices.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eneim/RVP/master/art/web_hi_res_512.png" width="256">

This very first commits include my own implementation for handling RecyclerView's Item click event.

### 1. Update

- 2015-12-15
  - First release. Including very based Adapter implementation which is less abstract, support a more powerful ViewHolder (which will ensure that your ViewHolder will correctly bind Data to its UI), and an implementation of OnItemClickListener. I borrow the idea from the legacy AdapterView<>.

### 2. More to go

- [ ] I would like to implement the usage of Content Provider Cursor and other Database Libraries usage with RecyclerView, for example: Realm.
- [ ] Item Animation and Decoration, inspired from the Video below.
- [ ] Custom Layout Manager.
- [ ] Will add more

### 3. Some open source resources used in this project

- Android Support Libraries (AppCompat, RecyclerView, Design, ...)
- I borrow a lot of codes from [Cheesesquare](https://github.com/chrisbanes/cheesesquare)
- This black good looking [ICON](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/326723/quilt_view_icon#size=128) was made better by [Android Asset Studio](http://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/)
- Amazing Reference from [Android Summit Video - RecyclerView~](https://youtu.be/imsr8NrIAMs)
- Some other open source libraries including [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso).
